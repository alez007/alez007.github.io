## ITravels

I'm a software engineer, travelling back and forth the IT plane between technologies, frustrations, excitement and failures. 

I'm always a student, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, can't hurt, right? Right????

### What's this about ? 

This is about me, yes, about me trying to see if I have the patience to write a blog. If you'll see last article date a year ago, you'll know I've failed (again), in which case you should probably search through the Failures section :innocent:.
