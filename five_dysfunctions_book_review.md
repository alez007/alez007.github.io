## 5 Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencionni - Book Review

### Intro
No need for too much introduction, book can be found on Audible and any other store. It's got a fair amount of reviews
but make sure you never take any book too literally, life is more complicated than that. 

### Review
#### 1. Absence of Trust
**What's the definition of trust in the context of building a team?**

It's not easy to nurture trust because in the course of their
lifetime, people are being pushed towards challenging one
another, competing, therefore this behaviour might be hard to
accept initially. 

**What should happen?**
- \-  team members should have confidence that their peer’s intentions
   are good and there’s no reason to be protective of careful
   around the group
- \-  team members must learn to be vulnerable with one
   another and be confident that their vulnerability is not going to
   be used against them
   
**What are some vulnerabilities?**
- \-  professional weaknesses or skill deficiencies
- \-  interpersonal problems
- \-  mistakes and will to requests for help

If people are trustful in their team members, they can then
concentrate their energy into simply doing the job at hand rather
than being political with one another.

**What are some tools to help us build trust?**
- \-  **Personal experiences exercise**: answering questions about
  ourselves e.g. siblings, personal hobbies, best job, worst job -
  this adds personal level to our relationship (time required 1h)
- \-  **Team effectiveness exercise**: team members to identify the
  single most important attribute that each of the other members
  can bring to the team and also the single most important
  attribute they need to improve upon; we focus on one person at
  a time, starting with the team leader (time required 1h)
- \-  **Myers Briggs type indicator (MBTI)**: it’s good for providing the
  best indicators about each one’s personalities and is not
  judgemental, no type is better than another; it’s based on
  research and members take active roles into identifying their
  own types (time required 4h)
- \-  **360 Feedback**

**Connection to dysfunction 2 (Fear of conflict)**:  by building trust,
team makes conflict possible; members know they are not going to be
punished by participating in discussions and debates

#### 2. Fear of conflict
It’s important that team members to believe that conflict is necessary.

**Definition**
- \-  in the context of the team this is related to ideological conflict
  and not mean-spirited hurtful one; it can have passion but it
  cannot be mistaken with discord or quarrel; members emerge
  from this conflict with no collateral damage and with eagerness
  to take on the next important issue
- \-  healthy conflict is a time saver because members do postpone
  discussions and take action faster
  
**Tools to help us build constructive conflict**:
- \-  **miner of conflict**: 
    * in the meeting at least one member
      needs to become the miner of conflict, the person who
      will try to be complete the objective and stay with the conflict
      until it is resolved
    * the miner of conflict needs to understand when team
      members are becoming uncomfortable with the level of
      discord and remind them that this discussion is necessary
- \-  **Thomas Kilmann conflict mode instrument (TKI)**: allows
members to understand their natural inclination towards conflict
and allows them to easily understand each other

**Connection to dysfunction 3 (Lack of commitment)**:  by engaging in
productive conflict, a team can commit and buy into a decision knowing
that the decision has benefited from all their ideas

#### 3. Lack of Commitment
**Definition**:
- \-  Great teams make clear decisions and no member has doubts
  about the actions that have been agreed on
- \-  Great teams search for consensus; reasonable human beings
  do not need their opinions to be implemented but they need their
  opinions to be heard and considered
- \-  If consensus is not possible due to an impasse, then the leader
  of the team is allowed to make the call
- \-  Great teams unite behind decisions even if it’s little assurance
  that their decision is correct; they go by the military axiom that a
  wrong decision is better than no decision; it’s better to make a
  decision boldly and be wrong then change decision with equal
  boldness than not take any decision at all
- \-  In contrast, teams that have this dysfunction delay their decision
  until they are being sure that the decision is the correct one; as
  prudent as this might seem, it’s dangerous as it paralyses the
  team’s results
  
**Tools to help build commitment**:
- \-  **Cascading messaging (clarity from top down regarding what needs to be done)**:
at the end of any staff meeting, team
leads need to discuss specific outcomes and what needs to be
communicated to the team
- \-  **Deadlines**: ensure the existence of clear deadlines at the end of
the decision; the worst enemy is ambiguity;
- \-  **Contingency and worst case scenario analysis**: make sure
we have a contingency plan and communicate it

**Connection to dysfunction 4 (Avoidance of accountability)**:
In order for us to call on each other actions, we need to have a
clear definition of what we need to do.
