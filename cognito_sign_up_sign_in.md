## Cognito Sign Up / Sign In

Main aim of this article is to exemplify a simple registration and login with AWS. We'll use Cognito, Lambda and DynamoDB. 

### What is Cognito ? 
It's an authentication and authorization service. What's the difference ? Well, *authentication* authenticates, *authorization* authorizes. 

What I mean is, if you sign in with your username and password, you *authenticate* yourself into the system.This means the system agrees you are a valid identity, but not necessarily one that is *authorized* to access certain parts of it. *Authorization* is your permission to see or access certain parts of the system you're *authenticated* into.
